[ARTICLE 1: The Open Network Unveils $124M Incentives Program Amid Soaring Growth - "The Defiant"]

The TON Foundation, the organization building The Open Network (TON), the blockchain previously know
n as Telegram Open Network, is launching a program distributing nine figures worth of incentives to 
developers and users.  Announced on March 20, the foundation will distribute  of its native Toncoin 
tokens to active users through its newly announced Open League campaign. With Toncoin currently trad
ing for $4.13, the rewards on offer are worth roughly $124 million.  The Open League will take place
 over four month-long seasons starting April 1. The first season will offer roughly $15 million wort
h of tokens to developers that meet key performance indicators and top a competitive . Approximately
 $22 million will also be up for grabs for dApp users in the form of quests, airdrops, and incentive
s for liquidity providers.  “The Open League and its massive rewards are designed to create a positi
ve ‘flywheel’ for TON projects,” the foundation . “The hypothesis is simple – once the world sees ho
w every project in The Open League can make millions of Telegram users go on-chain; TON becomes the 
obvious choice for every mass audience consumer product on the planet.”  The foundation already comp
leted a two-week Open League pilot that distributed 650,000 Toncoin (nearly $2.7 million). The found
ation attributes the pilot to a 70% increase in the total value locked (TVL) on TON and a 370% incre
ase in daily active wallets since the pilot kicked off.  TON adoption surges -------------------  Th
e Open Network’s TVL has soared 133% over the past four weeks, jumping to $218.7 million from $93.7 
million.  However, Toncoin liquid staking protocols dominate the network’s TVL rankings, with Tonsta
kers boasting a 53% dominance with $116.4 million, followed by Bemo with $30.3 million.  TON-native 
decentralized exchanges Ston.fi and DeDust come in third and fourth with $29.9 million and $25.27, w
hile Stakee, another liquid staking protocol, ranks fifth with $11.2 million. TON's top five DeFi pr
otocols account for 97.4% of the network's TVL combined.  The price of Toncoin is also up 53% in the
 past two weeks and nearly 100% since Feb. 26, falling just 10% shy of its November 2021 all-time hi
gh of $4.50, according to CoinGecko.  TON/USD. Source: CoinGecko.  On Feb. 28, Telegram, the popular
 encrypted messaging app, also  it would begin sharing 50% of advertising revenue with channel owner
s via Toncoin in March.  Telegram originally began developing TON in 2018, but the company later aba
ndoned the project following a protracted battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in
 2020. While the TON Foundation took over development, TON became the official web3 infrastructure p
latform for Telegram in September 2023 following an agreement between the two entities.  Memecoin la
unchpad Pump.Fun is surpassing its all-time highs yet again, in what has been a common occurrence in
 2024.  Daily active addresses reached 78,000 on Oct. 17, a 20% increase from its previous local hig
h of 65,000 on July 31. The number of tokens launched in a single day also broke to new highs on Oct
 14 with 25,000 unique memecoins created, a 22% increase from its previous high of 20,400 on August 
13.  As a result, Pump.Fun is back in the top 5 revenue generators with $7.3 million in revenue over
 the last seven days, according to . Pump.Fun is currently generating more revenue than its parent n
etwork, Solana, which earned $6.2 million in the same period.  The current spike in activity is a co
mbination of the market’s increasing risk appetite as Bitcoin approaches $69,000, as well as a flurr
y of attention surrounding the memecoin.  $GOAT, now above a $400 million market capitalization, has
 spawned an entire “AI meta” within the memecoin space, leading to mass deployments and trades on Pu
mp.Fun. The parabolic price action makes $GOAT the highest-valued token to be birthed on the launchp
ad, surpassing $MICHI, which previously reached $208 million.  Pump.Fun took to social media to cele
brate the victory and , “It seems like each week is getting crazier and crazier, with AIs, robots an
d other kinds of "innovative tech" taking over. Most importantly, a new king has been crowned:.”  Ta
piocaDAO, an omnichain money market built on LayerZero, suffered a security breach of its token depl
oyer address early Friday morning. Cybersecurity firm Cyvers alerted that an attacker had drained an
d swapped nearly $1.6 million worth of TAP tokens, prompting the token to collapse 95%.  The news is
 devastating for a project that had reportedly $2.1 million on audits and recently launched its test
net.  According to Cyvers, an exploiter used the Emergency Rescue function on a Tapioca vesting cont
ract and funneled nearly 28 million TAP tokens to an address under their control. These tokens were 
then dumped for 591 ETH in a single transaction and bridged to the BNB Chain from Arbitrum.  “The fu

XBT added that the project to a contagious interview scam that has hit several protocols of late.  T
AP is on life support after dropping more than 95% to $0.07.  TAP Price  Hakan Unal, Senior SOC Lead
 at Cyvers, told The Defiant that this type of breach is common. He explained that the deployer cont
rolling the TapiocaDAO contract likely downloaded malware, which gave the attacker access to the key
s and the smart contract.

[ARTICLE 3: Telegram-Linked TON Blockchain Down as Binance, Bybit Suspend Trading - Decrypt]

The Open Network (TON), initially developed by brothers Pavel and Nikolai Durov, went dark late Tues
day evening, with eagle-eyed users reporting the protocol had stopped processing transactions.  The 
network, formerly associated with the messaging platform Telegram, has not produced any new blocks f
or the last four hours, according to blockchain explorer .  Posting from its X account, TON confirme
d "a disruption in block production to its network," adding the issue is occurring "due to the abnor
mal load."  "Several validators are unable to clean the database of old transactions, which has led 
to losing the consensus," it said.  Validators are rushing to restart their nodes and software follo
wing a call from the chain's development team, TON Core, to reestablish network consensus.  Binance 
and have suspended deposits and withdrawals to and from the network, _Decrypt_ confirmed.  A represe
ntative for the network did not immediately return a request for comment.  Tonscan had on X earlier 
on Tuesday that the launch of the meme coin was "causing quite a lot of traffic" on the network "wit
h a few central services taking a little break."  Durov, alongside his brother Nikolai, unveiled the
 layer-1 blockchain in 2018 via a Telegram Whitepaper. That was followed up by the project's initial
 coin offering—the second largest in history—of its Gram token.  The Securities and Exchange Commiss
ion later halted the project, viewing its Gram token offering as unregistered securities.  After Tel
egram withdrew in 2020, community developers continued the project, launching the current network le
d by Anatoliy Makosov and Kirill Emelianenko.  Durov was in Paris on Saturday, facing charges of fac
ilitating illegal transactions, refusing to cooperate with law enforcement, and allowing child porno
graphy, drug distribution, organized fraud, money laundering, and illegal cryptographic activities t
o go unchecked on Telegram.  Despite distancing itself from the project in recent years, Telegram ha
s begun rembracing it, including paying channel owners a cut of ad revenue via Toncoin (TON)—the net
work's native token.  In August, Telegram introduced a feature enabling content creators to earn cry
pto via the in-app currency "Stars," which can be converted to TON or used for advertising payments.
  The price of TON remained slightly unchanged on Tuesday, though it has been more than 20% since Du
rov was arrested.  Telegram's user base exceeded 950 million in July, according to Durov, fueled by 
a rise in users drawn to crypto-based games offered through integrated "mini-apps" on the platform. 
 The most popular, Hamster Kombat, has reportedly garnered over 300 million players in recent months

[ARTICLE 4: Telegram Gets a Crypto Wallet—3 Years After SEC Pumped the Brakes - Decrypt]

The Open Network Foundation (TON Foundation) announced Wednesday that messaging app Telegram will ad
d a self-custodial crypto wallet for the chat platform’s users, taking The Open Network (TON) closer
 to its spiritual roots.  The TON Foundation said that a self-custodial digital wallet, TON Space, h
as launched on Telegram and is now available to the chat platform’s approximately 800 million users.
 In addition, the Foundation said that projects built on TON will get priority access to the messagi
ng app’s advertising platform, Telegram Ads.  The wallet feature is currently accessible in Telegram
’s settings, a TON spokesperson said, and a global rollout will begin in November, “excluding the U.
S. and some other countries.”  TON, a proof-of-stake blockchain platform, was by Telegram in 2020. I
t was slated to go live after two-and-a-half years of work on the platform, but Telegram’s involveme
nt was cut short by a lawsuit from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The 
SEC sued Telegram in 2019 over $1.7 billion raised via the project’s initial coin offering (ICO) thr
ough a token called Grams. An alleged offering of unregistered securities, Telegram settled with the
 SEC, paying back investors any unspent funds along with a $18.5 million fine.  A refund was already
 in the works: Telegram had promised to return funds to users if the platform didn’t go live by a in
 the spring of 2020.  Similar to Tesla owner Elon Musk’s ambitions for Twitter (or X) as both a paym
ents and media app, Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov envisioned TON as a way to send crypto within ch
ats and monetize the messaging app.  In a 2020 , which officially said that “Telegram’s active invol
vement with TON is over,” Durov warned of other crypto projects co-opting TON’s name and tech. He sa
id then that the firm was “unlikely to ever support them in any way,” making Wednesday’s move an app
arent about-face.  Community organizations emerged to keep the dream behind TON alive in Telegram’s 
wake, including organizations like FreeTon, NewTON, and the .  Telegram's Chief Investment Officer J
ohn Hyman said giving users ownership of their identities and assets aligns with the company’s belie
fs toward free speech.  "With this announcement, we are putting digital ownership rights in the hand
s of our entire user base," he said in a release, "while also giving TON projects the tools to reach
 our audience in the largest Web3/Web2 integration there has ever been."  TON Foundation announced l
ast week that it’s in Switzerland, where the organization is now registered as a nonprofit. Steve Yu
n, president of TON Foundation, spoke to the synergistic elements of TON and Telegram’s collaboratio
n in a written statement.   “TON ecosystem strives to provide a simple and intuitive user experience
 akin to that of the popular social applications, like Telegram,” he said. “Sharing the same DNA, we
 invite all builders to join our journey to mass adoption.”  Around the time Telegram withdrew from

[ARTICLE 7: The Open Network: Backed by Telegram, Exploring the Path of Interconnectivity Between Web2 and Web3 | by LD Capital | Medium]

August 14th marks the 10th anniversary of Telegram, with founder and CEO Pavel Durov outlining in hi
s 10th-anniversary message that Telegram’s next step is to go beyond mere information transmission a
nd lead the innovation in social media. Due to its information encryption and privacy features, Tele
gram has become one of the most popular communication applications.  This year’s Telegram Bot craze 
has also caught the market’s attention. However, Telegram bots merely use the Telegram application a
s an interface for the Ethereum protocol and do not directly interact with the TON (Telegram Open Ne
twork) blockchain. TON emerged from the Telegram Open Network blockchain platform initiated by Teleg
ram in 2017 but had to halt its operations due to SEC charges. Subsequently, the Telegram community,
 through spontaneous organization, renamed the network as the Open Network (TON) and continued its n
etwork development and ecosystem expansion. Currently, TON’s governance token TON has a market value
 surpassing Polkadot and Polygon, ranking 12th overall and 6th among public blockchains. Despite Tel
egram no longer being involved in TON network development, TON could still gain significant traffic 
through its association with Telegram. Telegram bots have also brought about a paradigm shift in use
r experience from Web 2 applications to Web 3, offering low-cost, low-threshold entry into Web 3.  *
*I. Network Framework**  **I. Network Framework**  TON’s structure is a multi-layer, multi-chain sys
tem consisting of the master chain, workchains, and shard chains. The master chain serves as a centr
al manager, while workchains support smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Differe
nt workchains need only adhere to unified interoperability standards, similar to Polkadot. Each work
chain implements shard chains to enhance scalability and parallel transaction processing, with each 
shard responsible for a specific subset of accounts.  TON currently adopts a PoS (Proof of Stake) co
nsensus mechanism. Three roles exist within the network:  1) Validator Nodes: Maintain network secur
ity by staking TON tokens.  2) Fishermen: Detect whether validator nodes fulfill their validation ta
sks by sending invalid proof. Validator nodes face penalties if they fail this proof.  3) Collators:
 Check the state of the shard and adjacent shard and send it to validator nodes. Collators are typic
ally rewarded by validator nodes.  **II. Roadmap**  **II. Roadmap**  1\. Strengthen detection and pe
nalties for non-compliant validator nodes.  2\. Create cross-chain bridges with the Ethereum and Bin
ance Smart Chain networks.  3\. Allow stakers to participate in on-chain governance.  4\. Introduce 
payment channels supporting instant micropayments between any two participants, free except for netw
ork fees incurred during channel creation and closure.  **III. Token Situation**  **III. Token Situa
tion**  After the launch of the Telegram Open Network testnet 2, 5 billion tokens were minted, with 
1.45% allocated to developers and testers. However, the SEC quickly banned Telegram from issuing tok
ens to investors, leading Telegram to cease its work within the TON ecosystem. Testnet 2 tokens were
 placed within smart contracts. All available Toncoin (TON) tokens are released through mining. Thes
e tokens are held in a special Giver smart contract, allowing anyone to participate in mining until 
the mining deadline on June 28, 2022.  After the initial distribution, TON entered the PoS phase. Ac
cording to the whitepaper, rewards for the PoS network amount to around 20% of staked tokens, with a
n annual inflation rate of approximately 2%, doubling the token supply in an estimated 35 years. Cur
rently, the total token supply is 5.093 billion, with a circulating supply of 3.441 billion.  **Use 
Cases**  **Use Cases**  1\. Payments: Domain Name System (DNS), data storage, TON proxies, on-chain 
gas, cross-chain fees, etc.  2\. Staking: Maintaining network security, with a portion of tokens con
fiscated from penalized validator nodes likely to be burned (specific ratio unspecified).  3\. Gover
nance  **IV. Network Data**  **IV. Network Data**  The TON network currently has 343 validator nodes
 in the verification phase, with a total staked TON token count of 486 million, accounting for 9.5% 
of the total token supply and 14.12% of the circulating token supply. Tokens destroyed amount to 41,
600. Starting from January 2022, network account numbers and active addresses have steadily increase
d, with a total account count of 3.351 million, approximately 765,000 active addresses, a daily aver
age of 160,000 transactions, and a daily increase in on-chain addresses ranging from 700 to 900.  De
spite the total number of account addresses exceeding 3 million, the Jetto wallet has only 133,000 u
sers deeply involved in the Ton ecosystem. (Note: Jetto represents the Ton network token standard, a
nd the Jetto wallet includes any Jetto tokens. The number of forged NFTs stands at 1.194 million. Th
e number of sold DNS is 32,000 (the number of forged ENS domain names on Ethereum is 2.574 million).
 Sales revenue amounts to 6.205 million TON, estimated at 10.67 million USD at the current price, wi
th an average price of 333 USD per DNS, which is relatively high.  **V. Ecology**  **V. Ecology**  T
he current Ton network ecosystem is led by the Ton Foundation, which is 100% community-driven. Since
 the beginning of 2023, the Ton Foundation’s main activities include:  1) Regular liquidity funding 
rewards.  2) A comprehensive accelerator program, launched in May 2023, with a funding allocation of
 25 million USD. The Ton Foundation has announced the projects funded in the second and third quarte
rs of 2022 and 2023. According to the reports, a total of 31 projects were funded in 2022, 10 projec
ts were funded in the second quarter of 2023, and 5 projects were funded in the third quarter, with 
a focus on infrastructure.  3) Development plans for Telegram. In August, the Ton Foundation launche
d the tApps center, a platform that includes any app that supports the Telegram ecosystem. In Septem
ber, they introduced the web3 Grant program for Telegram, without specifying the exact amount, but e
ach project’s funding is expected to be between 20,000 and 50,000 USD.  According to Defillama, Ton’
s current Total Value Locked (TVL) is 9.85 million USD, with the historical high point being only 21
.04 million USD. Ton’s ecosystem is in a very early stage of development.  【DEX】  Megaton Finance  A
n AMM DEX developed by the South Korean blockchain technology company OZYS, originally built on the 
Klaytn platform as Klayswap. The current TVL has reached 4.89 million USD, accounting for approximat

rom Cypher Capital, First Stage Labs, Orbs, MEXC Ventures, and other institutions. The project token
 $MEGA is listed on MEXC, with 54% of tokens allocated to liquidity providers.  DeDust  Developed by
 Scaleton, it now supports almost all available wallets in the Ton blockchain. They recently release
